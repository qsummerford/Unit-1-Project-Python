# Unit-1-Project-Python

# This is a group project.

## Description and Motivation:
We are making a RPG using the knowledge we gained from the Explorer and Turned-Based Health Depleter games. The game is set in a guantlet that you are trying to escape. This game combines a lot, if not more, of the things we already learned.  

## Prior Arts:
This game is inspired by other RPGs. The characters are based off of many RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons, For Honor, and Soul Calibur. The guantlet idea is inspired by most generic conflicts in video games.

## Core User Workflows:
The game is set in a dungeon with many tests of strength for your character. The user starts out as a character that they name. They have to move through the dungeon and fight many trials to claim victory.

## How Will You Utilize The Content Covered This Unit:
We will use data classes to store the health and attack of the enemies and users. We will also use functions to control health and different attacks of the enemy and the user. We will also use dictionaries to pick up the weapons and move to all of the rooms.
